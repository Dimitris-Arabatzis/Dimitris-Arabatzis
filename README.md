# ABOUT ME

## Who Am I 👋

Hello, my name is Dimitris Martin Arampatzis. I’m an engineer at CubeRM where i develop the backend using mostly .NET and the Azure Stack, but _this blog, its content and opinions are my own._

I am currently located in Thessaloniki, Greece where i work remotely.

## Interests 👀

My interests lay in the _Cloud Platforms, .NET, Open Web, Entrepreneurship and the application of management in a way that increases productivity_. Since you are here you will see some of my rumblings about these topics.

**Motos** you will often hear me say: 🌱

- “Leave it better than you found it”.
- “Give time now, to what saves you time later”.

I am a firm believer in the Agile methodologies and I strive to make my team’s life easier.

## Beginnings of a Software Developer

I started out dabbling with programming back when i was 14 when my dad showed me an early windows phone and said: "You write a program that outputs the current GPS location, and this phone will be yours." As you can imagine, i fell in love with programming after that and didn't care much about that phone.

As a kid, the vision of what i wanted to become when i grow up, went from Astronaut, straight to Software Developer.

## How it continued

I Graduated from International Hellenic University with a BsC of Computer Science. During this time, I learned Java, Javascript and developed a CMS system.

I am currently doing my Masters in Business Administration and Information Systems in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

## Professional Career

- It all began with Veltio, the first company i joined as a Software developer.
  I helped with their cloud platforms and developed a solution to monitor all of the company's infrastructure.

- The next step was AntyxSoft Cloud, where i had the opportunity to work along some of the leading figures of IT in Thessaloniki.
  I consulted international clients and recreated the company's web platform along the way.

- I’m currently a software engineer at CubeRM, a company that gives a new meaning to Tendering worldwide.

I’ve been moving along the software developer titles. Through all positions, the common thread is I’ve kept coding, even when managing a small team and helping shape products.

Technologies I’ve used along the way include .NET, SQL Server, Microsoft Azure, Powershell, PHP, JavaScript, and more. I have a huge list of things that i still want to accomplish though. It’s been a rollercoaster, but my favorite part of it all is continuing to learn in the only industry that refuses to stand still.

_That's me, today. I'll be different tomorrow, hopefully better._
